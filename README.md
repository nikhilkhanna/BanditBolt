Download the game here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tangledfire.AndroidGame
There are two main folders in this repository: AndroidGame holds all the code that isn't platform specific (i.e. basically all of the gameplay)
AndroidGame-Android contains Android specific code such as launching the game from Android "rate this app" dialog and in app purchases. It also contains an assets folder which has the level data (which are encoded in text files during level editing and later parsed) and the languanges.xml (which is used for easily localizing the game)
Note: For security and copyright purposes, none of the art assets are included in this public repository
